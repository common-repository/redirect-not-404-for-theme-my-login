Bolt on to the Theme My Login plugin. Instead of giving 404 error for wp-login.php, it redirects to the relevant TML page.

== Description ==

Bolt on to the Theme My Login plugin by Jeff Farthing. Instead of giving 404 error - if disable wp-login.php is selected - it redirects to the relevant TML page.

I created this because there were many links on my sites to /wp-login.php and /wp-login.php?action=register and enabling this security option broke the site.

The code was written by Jeff on the forum - I'm publishing it to help others who may have had the same issue.

== Installation ==

Install and activate the plugin - that is all!
To test it is working go to /wp-login.php on your site and you should end up on the TML login page (/login by default)
